This dataset is from Fanaee-T and Gama (2013) and is hosted by the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).\n\n**Goal**: We want to learn to predict bike rental counts (per hour) from information such as day of the week, weather, season, etc.  Having good predictions of customer demand allows a business or service to prepare and increase supply as needed.\n\n**Approach**: We will use Spark ML Pipelines, which help users piece together parts of a workflow such as feature processing and model training.

Most ML algorithms expect to predict a single \"label\" column (`cnt` for our dataset) using a single \"features\" column of feature vectors.  For each row in our data, the feature vector should describe what we know: weather, day of the week, etc., and the label should be what we want to predict (`cnt`).\n\nWe will put together a simple Pipeline with the following stages:\n* `VectorAssembler`: Assemble the feature columns into a feature vector.\n* `VectorIndexer`: Identify columns which should be treated as categorical.  This is done heuristically, identifying any column with a small number of distinct values as being categorical.  For us, this will be the `yr` (2 values), `season` (4 values), `holiday` (2 values), `workingday` (2 values), and `weathersit` (4 values).\n* `GBTRegressor`: This will use the [Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) algorithm to learn how to predict rental counts from the feature vectors.\n* `CrossValidator`: The GBT algorithm has several [hyperparameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization), and tuning them to our data can improve accuracy.  We will do this tuning using Spark's [Cross Validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_&#40;statistics&#41;) framework, which automatically tests a grid of hyperparameters and chooses the best.\n\n![Image of

This section describes how to take this notebook and improve the results even more.  Try copying this notebook into your Databricks account and extending it, and see how much you can improve the predictions.\n\nThere are several ways we could further improve our model:\n* **Expert knowledge**: We may not be experts on bike sharing programs, but we know a few things we can use:\n  * The count of rentals cannot be negative.  `GBTRegressor` does not know that, but we could threshold the predictions to be `>= 0` post-hoc.\n  * The count of rentals is the sum of `registered` and `casual` rentals.  These two counts may have different behavior.  (Frequent cyclists and casual cyclists probably rent bikes for different reasons.)  The best models for this dataset take this into account.  Try training one GBT model for `registered` and one for `casual`, and then add their predictions together to get the full prediction.\n* **Better tuning**: To make this notebook run quickly, we only tried a few hyperparameter settings.  To get the most out of our data, we should test more settings.  Start by increasing the number of trees in our GBT model by setting `maxIter=200`; it will take longer to train but can be more accurate.\n* **Feature engineering**: We used the basic set of features given to us, but we could potentially improve them.  For example, we may guess that weather is more or less important depending on whether or not it is a workday vs. weekend.  To take advantage of that, we could build a few feature by combining those two base features.  MLlib provides a suite of feature transformers; find out more in the [ML guide](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html).\n\n*Good luck!*","commandVersion":1,"state":"finished","results":{"type":"raw","data":"","arguments":{}},"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0.0,"submitTime":0.0,"finishTime":0.0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"nuid":"1d7e673c-e7a3-44ed-8722-6401d74ab963"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":503877321549243,"guid":"4ff2ecc7-8f1f-4afb-a515-5bfff7887db3","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":42.0,"command":"%md #### Learning more\n\nCheck out the other example notebooks in this guide for more ideas about Pipelines, working with datasets, and more.
